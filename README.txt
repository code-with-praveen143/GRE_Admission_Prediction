GRE Admission Prediction System using Machine Learning

## Introduction:
The GRE Admission Prediction System is a machine learning-based application that predicts the likelihood of a student's admission to a graduate program based on their GRE scores and other relevant factors. This system utilizes various machine learning algorithms to provide accurate predictions, enabling prospective students to assess their chances of admission.

## Tech Stack:
- Python: Programming language used for the development of the application.
- scikit-learn: Python library for machine learning, utilized for model development, evaluation, and preprocessing.
- Flask: Web framework used for deploying the prediction system as a web application.
- HTML/CSS: Used for designing the user interface of the web application.
- Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- NumPy: Library for scientific computing, used for numerical operations and array manipulation.

## Installation:
1. Install Python (version X.X.X) from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub: [GitHub repository URL].
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Install the required dependencies by running the command: pip install -r requirements.txt.

## Usage:
1. Ensure that you have the necessary dataset with GRE scores and admission outcomes in CSV format.
2. Open the `app.py` file and modify the data loading section to load your dataset.
3. Run the `app.py` file using the command: python app.py.
4. Access the application by opening a web browser and visiting the URL: http://localhost:5000.
5. Enter the required information, including GRE scores and other relevant factors, into the provided input fields.
6. Click on the "Predict" button to obtain the predicted likelihood of admission.
